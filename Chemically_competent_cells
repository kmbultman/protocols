# DH5α λpir Chemically compentent cells 
#### Modified from protocol written by Sourabh Dhingra by Katie Bultman 

1.	Inoculate 3-4 mls of LB in test tube with DH5α λpir (MJM537). Grow with rapid shaking O/N.
2.	Inoculate four 250 ml flask with 50 ml of 2X LB in each with 1ml of O/N culture.
3.	Grow at 37C, 250 rpm to reach an OD600 = 0.3
4.	Add 4 mls of 1M MgCl2
5.	Grow as in step 3 to OD600 = 0.45-0.55
6.	Cool on ice for 2 hours.
7.	Spin at 3000g for 5 mins. One flask in one tube. Rotor should be 4˚C
a.	Can use either swinging bucket or fixed rotor 
8.	Resuspend cells in 25 mls of chilled CaCl2 media each. Do not vortex.
9.	Place in ice for 40 mins, after spin at 3000g for 5 mins at 4C
10.	Resuspend cells in 1.2 mls of chilled CaCl2 media + Glycerol.
11.	Aliquot 200 μl in cold sterile micro centrifuge tubes.
12.	Store at -80˚C (-70˚C also fine).
