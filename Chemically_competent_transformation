# Chemically competent DH5α λpir transformation 
#### Protocol from Sourabh Dhingra 

1.	Obtain the required number of Competent cells from -80C and put them on ice. Let them thaw on ice.
2.	Label the tubes for transformation plus a positive and negative and put them on ice so tubes are cold before you transfer the cells.
3.	Once cells are thawed and tubes are cooled aliquot the amount of competent cells in each tube. (e.g If competent cells tube have 200 ul and you are doing a vector only and vector plus insert you can divide 50ul in 4 tubes including positive and negative)
4.	Transfer your DNA to the appropriately labeled tube and mix by pipetting 2-3 times.
5.	Leave all samples on ice for 15 mins.
6.	Place in water bath at 37C for Exactly 2 mins. Do not leave the room. Be close to the tubes.
7.	After 2 mins take them out and place them on ice.
8.	Add 500ul of LB media and mix by pipetting .
9.	Put in rotating shaker for 45 mins to 4 hours.
10.	Plate 200ul on selective medium (Medium + antibiotic).
11.	Incubate O/N
12.	Do colony PCR of about 5 colonies to check the presence of your insert. (the colonies growing on positive plate can act as negative control for your colony PCR)
